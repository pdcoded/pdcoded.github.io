I"Ò<p>Hi Readers! My name is PD. I work as a Solutions Architect at Quantiphi. I  have a great experience in designing and building end-to-end ML systems across multiple domains. I have worked on a wide spectrum of problems from building domain-specific large-scale speech recognition systems for trading floor to architecting efficient NLU systems that can help students get better at comprehending course content.</p>

<p>There are two problems that excite me the most, and I spend a lot of time on::</p>

<p>1) Using AI, build technology to help human educators and students while maintaining instructional quality and high academic standards.</p>

<p>2) Tools and Platforms to lower the barrier to use AI</p>

<p>Music is something that allows me to connect with people easily. Huge fan (not limited to) of British/Irish Music like Radiohead, U2, DireStraits, Pink Floyd - You can find my Spotify profile [herehttps://open.spotify.com/user/prabhudatta?si=45ab750a215445d1)</p>
